Well guys,

Here is Yicong LI for the MPPT direct.

My work using the panel photovoltaic KC200GT, which we modelise in class BA04 in UTC.

First, I need to give you my understanding on MPPT direct.

MPPT means Maximum Power Point Tracking, 
that is to say to find the balance of V and I to maintain the largest power which is also called Maximum Power Point, 
because radiation and temprature is changing time to time, we need different algorithmes to track the MPP.
And direct means changing voltage directly, compared to MPPT indirect which changes reluctance to track MPP.

My responsibility is on P&O and its improvement. I hope you enjoy it. There are matlab codes, simulink model, and also the data, anything you can find here for your PV study.

Thank you, and have a nice day.

Juin 16th 2024 After BA04 final and presentation.
